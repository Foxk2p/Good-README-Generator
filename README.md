    Project Title:
      good-README-Generator
    
    Description:
      This is an application that runs in the NodeJS environment that generates a README.md file for a user's GitHub project. It was designed because a well developed README can often be the difference between a good project from a bad one.

    Use:
      Use this application for new GitHub projects that need an accompanying README file. Becasue it references the GitHub API for your user information, it can help expedite the process of including your basic account information. Use it to ensure that a useful and relevant REAME file accompanies your GitHub project.

    Steps To Use:
      Open the good-README-Generator folder in the terminal, and begin the process by typing "node index.js". The user will be prompted for their GitHub username, which will be used to make a call to the GitHub API to retrieve their email and profile image. Then, the user will be prompted with questions about their project. Once the user provides answers for each question, a new README file will be created using the users input and will be available within the project's folder.
